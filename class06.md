# Node.JS
## What is Node.js?
* Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
* The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
* Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond. As you’re only targeting one runtime (a specific version of the V8 engine), this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax. It also means that you don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues — as you would if you were writing JavaScript that would run in different browsers.

# NPM
* npm is the JavaScript Package Manager.
* npm is also the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week.
* npm can install packages locally and globally.

# Express.js

- **Express.js**, or simply **Express**, is a back end web application framework for Node.js.

- Released as free and open-source software under the MIT License.

- It is designed for building web applications and APIs.

- It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js. 

- The **express** framework is built on top of the **node.js** framework and helps in fast-tracking development of server-based applications. 

# Application Programming Interface

- In computing, an **application programming interface** is an interface that defines interactions between multiple software applications or mixed hardware-software intermediaries. 

- **API** is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.

- It is a set of functions that allows applications to access data and interact with external software components, operating systems, or microservices. 
  
- An API delivers a user response to a system and sends the system's response back to a user.
