### Node.js

- **Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

- As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

- A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.

### Here is how Node.js handles a file request:

* Sends the task to the computer's file system.
* Ready to handle the next request.
* When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
* Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.

* Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.
